- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MoonGoddess this is becuase my IRL name is Diana, so see I'm a really really geek.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in basically anything, I love tech.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CircuitPython
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, honestly, I don't know.   I haven't been doing the social stuff lately 

The main thing I use Github for is for MGHelm a program for a fake computer in a great game that hasen't come out yet.   Since the game is on hold right now, so is my coding for the helm.

I'll be honest, I really don't know how to properly use git or github.
